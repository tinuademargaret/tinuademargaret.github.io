## :woman_technologist: &nbsp;About me

💡 &nbsp;I'm a budding AI Research Engineer.\
🎓 &nbsp;I recently completed my masters in Artificial Intelligence at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), where I worked with Prof. Ioannis Konstas on Question Generation.\
🛠 &nbsp;I have previously worked at [Atom Learning](https://atomlearning.co.uk/), [Smartace](https://smartace.ng/) and [InventOne](https://inventone.ng/#/).\
🔭 &nbsp;My research interests are in reasoning, AI for science and AI alignment.\
